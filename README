Trying to prove the expensive use of mailboxSize in a feature of Akka, in this case, showing the bottleneck on the receive timeout feature.

Uncomment lines 43 to 47 and comment line 49 to perform the benchmark differences.

Benchmark results: (notice the difference in the parameters used. if I used the same ones, it would take much longer)
